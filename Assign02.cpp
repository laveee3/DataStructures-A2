// PROTOTYPES for functions used by this test program:

void print_menu();
// Pre:  (none)
// Post: A menu of choices for this program is written to cout.

char get_user_command();
// Pre:  (none)
// Post: The user is prompted to enter a one character command.
//       The next character is read (skipping blanks and newline
//       characters), and this character is returned.

int get_object_num();
// Pre:  (none)
// Post: The user is prompted to enter either 1, 2 or 3. The
//       prompt is repeated until a valid integer can be read
//       and the integer's value is either 1, 2 or 3. The valid
//       integer read is returned. The input buffer is cleared
//       of any extra input until and including the first
//       newline character.

int get_integer();
// Pre:  (none)
// Post: The user is prompted to enter an integer. The prompt
//       is repeated until a valid integer can be read. The
//       valid integer read is returned. The input buffer is
//       cleared of any extra input until and including the
//       first newline character.

void print_to_cout(SortedInt2 src);
// Pre:  (none)
// Post: The content of src is displayed on cout.
/* Quiz: Why isn't src passed by const reference? */
